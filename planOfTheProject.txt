First page:
Log in, and register page. 
For each of them the database will be used.

When a user log in, the credentinals will be checked with the database. And to register the user, the details will be put into the database.

If log in is succesfull, the Products page will show.


Use session, passport, user authentication , 
DATA BASE TO SAVE ALL OF THESE.


Second page:
Products, (profile, checkout, button) 

CRUD OPERATIONG ON PROFILE (EDIT PROFILE)

Document the API using Swagger 


1. Project Setup:

2. Database Design:
Nesecary tables:

users: for storing user data (id, email, password, etc.)
products: for storing product details (id, name, description, price, etc.)
cart: to represent each user's shopping cart.
cart_items: to represent individual items in a cart.
orders: to store information about placed orders.
order_items: to represent items within each order.
3. Setting Up Middleware:
Body Parsers & CORS: Use body-parser to parse incoming JSON and URL-encoded data. Allow cross-origin requests with CORS.
Session & Authentication: Set up sessions (using express-session) and integrate Passport for authentication.
Error Handling
4. API Endpoints:
Implement the necessary CRUD operations for:

Users:

Register
Login
View/Update profile
Delete account

Products:

Add a new product (admin functionality)
View products
Update a product's details (admin functionality)
Delete a product (admin functionality)
Cart:

Add items to a cart
View cart items
Update quantities of items in the cart
Remove items from the cart
Orders:

Place an order
View orders
Update order status (admin functionality, e.g., 'shipped', 'delivered')
Cancel/delete an order
5. Implement Authentication:
Use Passport with the "local" strategy for email and password authentication.
Protect routes as necessary, e.g., only logged-in users should be able to add items to their cart.
6. API Documentation:
Document all your endpoints using Swagger. This helps other developers understand how to use your API.
7. Testing:
Write unit tests for your models and integration tests for your routes. Tools like mocha, chai, or jest can be useful.
8. Deployment:
Choose a cloud provider (like Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) to deploy your API.
Deploy your Postgres database as well using the services provided by the cloud provider.
9. Version Control & Collaboration:
Use Git branches for developing features or fixing bugs.
Push your code to GitHub .

10. Additional :
Environment Variables: Store sensitive data like database credentials or secret keys using environment variables.
Logging: Use a logging library like winston to keep track of server operations and potential errors, maybe!
